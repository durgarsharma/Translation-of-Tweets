# Translation-of-Tweets

Abstract: Indiaâ€™s rich linguistic diversity often leads to the frequent
use of code-mixed languages, especially on social media platforms like X
(formerly Twitter). This study explores the use of Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs), specifically Anthropic and OpenAI, for the translation of
Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-mixed and code-switched tweets to identify
instances of cyberbullying directed at Indian athletes through the analy-
sis of over 29,000 tweets. Focusing on athletes from Cricket, Boxing, and
Wrestling, this research analyses the prevalence of cyberbullying over a
decade-long period from July 2013 to June 2023. The aim is to quantify
cyberbullying by classifying tweets into positive, neutral, and negative
categories, with sentiment scores ranging from -1 to +1. The study iden-
tified shifts from neutral to positive and neutral to negative sentiments,
where previously misclassified neutral tweets were more accurately rec-
ognized. The findings highlight the fluctuating public perception of ath-
letes, driven by their performance and media narratives. This research
underscores the challenges of processing code-mixed content and empha-
sises the need for improved NLP tools to more effectively detect harmful
sentiment and cyberbullying.
